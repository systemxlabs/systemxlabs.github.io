指是否立即处理该查询，或是等待系统有足够资源时再处理。\n进程模型\n每个 DBMS Worker 一个进程\n\n优点：可移植性好（早期的 OS 对线程支持较差），可以利用 OS 保护措施\n缺点：进程切换代价更大\n案例：DB2，PostgreSQL，Oracle\n\n每个 DBMS Worker 一个线程\n线程又可分为 OS线程 或 DBMS 线程（轻量级线程，仅在用户空间调度而没有内核调度程序的参与）。\n\n优点：线程切换代价较小，共享数据友好\n缺点：OS 对线程不提供溢出和指针的保护，调试困难，可移植性较差（在当时）\n案例：DB2，SQL Server，MySQL\n\n进程/线程池\n由中央进程/线程控制所有客户端连接，由进程/线程池管理所有 DBMS worker。大小可动态变化。\nDBMS worker 之间会共享数据\n\n磁盘缓冲池（buffer pool）\n锁表\n\nDBMS 可能支持多种进程模型，比如 DB2 支持以上四种，Oracle 在 Windows 系统上采用多线程模型。\n准入控制\n\n通过调度进程/线程来确保客户端连接数在一个临界值以下\n在查询语句转换和优化后的执行阶段，通过分析查询所需资源来决定是否推迟查询执行\n\n并行架构\n共享内存（Shared-Memory）\n\n在共享内存机器，OS 通常支持作业（进程或线程）被透明地分配到每个处理器上，并且共享的数据结构可以继续被所有作业所访问，所以上面四种进程模型可以运行良好。主要需要修改查询执行层，将单一的 SQL 并行到多个处理器上。\n无共享（Shared-Nothing）\n\n通过网络互联通信。表数据被水平分区到不同机器，对于每个 SQL 请求，会被发送到集群其他成员，然后各自并行执行查询本地所保存的数据。事务实现较复杂。可扩展性强。需要冗余数据来提高可用性。\n共享磁盘（Shared-Disk）\n\n单个 DBMS 执行节点发生故障不会影响其他节点访问整个数据库。需要手动协调多个节点的共享数据（分布式锁，分布式缓冲池）。\nNUMA（Non-Uniform Memory Access）\n\n处理器访问本地内存比远程内存更快。NUMA 允许共享内存系统扩展到更多数量处理器的规模。\n关系查询处理器\n查询解析\n检查语法、引用、权限等，将 SQL 转换为内部形式（逻辑计划）。\n查询重写\n简化和标准化查询。例如\n\n视图重写\n简化常量表达式（t.a &lt; 10 + 2 + t.b  =&gt;  t.a &lt; 12 + t.b）\n谓词逻辑重写（t.a &lt; 10 and t.a &gt; 20  =&gt;  false）\n语义优化（select t1.a from t1, t2 where t1.b = t2.b 且 外键约束把 t1.b 绑定到 t2.b  =&gt;  select t1.a from t1）\n\n查询优化\n将查询内部表示形式（逻辑计划）转化为一个高效的执行计划（物理计划）。涉及\n\n计划空间\n选择率估算（直方图）\n搜索算法（动态规划/级联搜索）\n并行（两阶段方案：先生成单机执行计划，再转换为分布式执行计划。单阶段方案则直接生成分布式执行计划）\n自动调优（如 learning optimizer）\n\n查询执行\n迭代器模型\nclass iterator {\n    iterator &amp;inputs[];\n    void init();\n    tuple get_next();\n    void close();\n}\n\n可以通过引入 Exchange 算子来实现并行。\n迭代器中元组可以是\n\n缓冲池中元组的引用（需要 pin 住所在页）\n从缓冲池中复制一份\n\n索引引用行\n\n使用物理地址 RID（例如 page id + slot num），只支持二级索引（非聚簇索引，减少聚簇索引 B+ 树分裂导致频繁的行移动）。速度快，但行移动开销大\n使用主键。支持聚簇索引和二级索引，但二级索引回表会牺牲一些性能\n\n数据仓库特点\n\n位图索引，min-max索引，布隆过滤\n需要快速批量导入数据\n物化视图（可以查询的实际表）\n重点优化基于雪花模型的聚合查询\n列存\n\n存储管理\n主要有两种基本类型的存储管理器\n\nDBMS 直接和底层磁盘驱动交互\nDBMS 使用标准 OS 文件系统\n\n主要从两方面优化\n\n空间：物理存储上的临近性（顺序读写），创建大文件\n时间：缓冲池替代 OS IO 缓冲机制（预读取，确保 WAL 落盘，双缓冲导致内存拷贝消耗）\n\n事务\nACID\n\n原子性：全做或全不做\n一致性：满足完整性约束\n隔离性：从应用开发者视角来看事务是隔离的，互不影响\n持久性：出现故障不会丢失更新\n\n三种主要的并发控制技术\n\n严格两阶段锁（2PL）：读数据需读锁，写数据需排他锁。事务拥有的锁在事务结束时释放\n多版本并发控制（MVCC）：为过去某一时间点的数据状态保存副本\n乐观并发控制（OCC）：事务提交时检测读写历史来判断是否冲突，冲突则回滚\n\n为减少锁请求和冲突，很多 DBMS 将 MVCC 或 OCC 作为 2PL 的一个补充。\n事务隔离级别\n\n读未提交：事务可以读任何已提交或未提交的数据（读操作不加锁）\n读已提交：事务可以读任何已提交的数据（读操作加锁，读完立即释放）\n可重复读：事务只能读取一个已提交数据的一个版本（读操作加上，事务结束释放）\n串行化\n\n除了 ANSI SQL 定义的隔离级别外，还有其他的隔离级别：游标稳定，快照隔离，读一致。\n数据库标准恢复机制采用 WAL 日志，为优化性能\n\n采用 DIRECT, STEAL/NOT-FORCE 模式运行\n\n数据项原地更新\n事务未提交时，其修改的缓冲页可以被刷盘\n当事务提交时，缓冲池不必强制刷盘\n\n\n采用逻辑操作和物理操作混合的日志模式（逻辑日志用于撤销，物理日志用于重做）\n\n索引 B+ 树并发控制\n\nLatch-coupling 方案（Crabing 协议）\nRight-link 方案\n\n解决幻读\n\n谓词锁：锁定原始查询谓词所表示的逻辑区域（代价高）\nnext-key 锁\n\n索引插入操作需要为大于其 key 的下一个元组分配排他锁\n读事务需要为下一个元组添加共享锁\n\n\n\n共享组件\n\n目录管理器\n\n管理元数据（用户/数据库/表/列/索引等），元数据以表形式存储在数据库中\n\n\n内存分配器\n磁盘管理器\n备份服务\n\n物理备份\n基于触发器的备份\n基于日志的备份\n\n\n管理、监控和工具\n\n","id":"https://systemxlabs.github.io/blog/architecture-of-a-database-system-paper/","title":"数据库系统架构论文"},"https://systemxlabs.github.io/blog/ballista-mvp-part1/":{"body":"Ballista

16 个。（在分布式环境下为了利用多个机器，支持更高的并行度，Ballista 提供了可以给每个 session 手动配置此项的支持）\nDatafusion 提供了 repartition_joins 开关项，基于 join key 进行 hash repartition 后可并行执行 hash join。\n这里其实还有优化空间，两个连续的 RepartitionExec

算子接收多个分区中间聚合结果数据并行执行，并行生成最终聚合结果\n第二阶段输入必须按照 group key 进行了重新分区\n场景：通常输入有多个分区（没有按 group keys 重新分区），查询有 group by 语句，且并行度大于 1\n\n两阶段并行哈希分组聚合（Partial-FinalPartioned）\n以 select a, b, avg(c) from t group by a, b 为例。\n第一阶段（Partial）\n\n不断从输入读取一批一批数据 (a, b, c)\n执行表达式求值和中间聚合计算，在内存中维护 group 值到中间聚合结果 (a, b) -&gt; (count(c), sum(c)) 的哈希表\n如果输入已按照 group keys 排序，则利用排序特性，提前输出部分已聚合完毕 group 的中间聚合结果到第二阶段（可以清空这部分内存）\n如果发现内存不足，则提前输出（early emit）内存中所有的已计算的中间聚合结果到第二阶段，清空内存中的哈希表\n如果发现是高基数聚合，则跳过聚合计算（不维护哈希表），将每行输入直接转换为中间聚合结果表达形式，输出到第二阶段\n\n第二阶段（FinalPartitioned）\n\n不断从输入读取一批一批中间聚合数据 (a, b, count(c), sum(c))\n将相同 group 的中间聚合结果合并，在内存中维护 group 值到中间聚合结果 (a, b) -&gt; (count(c), sum(c)) 的哈希表\n如果输入已按照 group keys 排序，则利用排序特性，提前输出部分已聚合完毕的 group，会基于中间聚合结果计算最终聚合结果 avg(c)，然后输出到下一算子（可以清空这部分内存）\n如果内存不足，则将内存中的哈希表溢出到磁盘（spill），溢出前会先按照 group keys 排好序，以 Arrow IPC 格式写入磁盘文件，然后清空内存哈希表，最后会将多个溢出文件以流的形式执行合并操作（stream merge），计算最终聚合结果 avg(c) 并输出到下一算子\n如果内存充足，则最后将整个内存中的哈希表，计算最终聚合结果 avg(c) 并输出到下一算子\n\n内存中的哈希表\n\n以上在逻辑上形成一个哈希表，group 索引、group 值和 Accumulator 一一对应，但物理上并非直接使用哈希表存储 group 到聚合状态的映射，实际上哈希表维护的是 group 值到 group 索引的映射，哈希表负责分配 group 索引，而另外有一个 Accumulator组 的数据结构通过类似 Vec 的结构存储每个 group 的聚合状态，每个 group 索引会对应其中一个 Accumulator。\n在接收一批数据时，先由哈希表来计算这批数据每行对应的 group 索引（可能是已存在的，也可能会分配一个新的），然后将这批数据和每行对应的 group 索引发送给 Accumulator组 来进行聚合状态更新。\nAccumulator组 在更新前会利用 Arrow 计算内核对数据进行一个高效地重排，以便在更新聚合状态时，可以被编译器很好地向量化（SIMD加速）。\n\n利用类似 Vec 连续内存存储，尽可能减少内存分配，尽可能类型特化，可以最大化提高聚合计算效率。\ngroup 在分区上的分布\n\n在第一阶段，每个分区上都可能存在任意的 group，在进入第二阶段前，会按照 group keys 进行重新分区，因此在第二阶段，每个分区上的 group 不会存在重叠。\n利用输入的排序特性\nDataFusion 会利用聚合算子的输入在 group keys 上的（部分/完全）排序特性，来加速聚合计算。\n假如聚合算子输入按照 group keys a 和 b 完全排序，\n\n当出现新的 group 值时，说明前面的 group 已经聚合完毕，不会再有新的行出现，此时我们可以将前面 group 聚合计算结果提前发送到下一阶段算子。\n高基数聚合跳过第一阶段\n当出现高基数聚合（group 比较分散，默认阈值是行数大于 100000 并且 group 数量与行数比值大于 0.8）时，这时第一阶段在内存中需要维护巨大的哈希表，不仅浪费内存，而且第一阶段并不能显著减少数据量，此时会跳过第一阶段内的聚合计算，每行数据 (a, b, c) 直接被转换为中间聚合结果形式 (a, b, count(c), sum(c))，然后输出到第二阶段。\nTopK 聚合\n当查询（... order by xxx limit xxx）满足特定条件时，优化规则会将 limit 下推到 Aggregate 算子，在执行时会直接走 TopK 聚合计算，采用一种 Map 和优先队列的组合结构，避免在内存中维护巨大的哈希表，减少内存占用以及计算量。\n其他一些问题\n第一阶段判断是否跳过聚合计算时，为什么需要输入无任何在 group keys 上的排序特性？\n因为如果输入具有排序特性，那么可以利用排序特性来提前输出部分已聚合完毕的 group，这样不会因为高基数聚合导致需要在内存中维护巨大的哈希表。\n为什么 Spill（溢出到磁盘）仅发生在第二阶段（FinalPartitioned），而不会在第一阶段（Partial）发生？\nSpill 是一个耗时的操作，涉及到磁盘 IO 和排序，而且对于高基数聚合（group 非常分散），很可能在第二阶段仍需要 Spill。所以通常的做法是在第一阶段内存不足时将内存中数据提前输出到第二阶段（early emit），在第二阶段内存不足时采用 Spill 溢出到磁盘。\n为什么 Spill（溢出到磁盘）之前需要对数据按照 group keys 进行排序？\n如果发生 Spill，说明数据量过大内存不足，无法在内存中对数据进行分组，唯一的方式就是进行流式地 读取-聚合-输出。所以我们提前对 Spill 到磁盘的数据进行排序，在流式读取所有磁盘文件时执行合并（stream merge），利用输入的完全排序特性，可以流式地输出一组组聚合结果。\n参考资料\n\nAggregating Millions of Groups Fast in Apache Arrow

t0(a int, b int) 和 t1(c int, d int)\n\nselect * from t0 join t1 on t0.a = t1.c 有一个 On 条件且是等值条件，走 Hash Join 算子\nselect * from t0 join t1 on t0.a &gt; t1.c 有一个 On 条件但非等值条件，走 Nested Loop Join 算子\nselect * from t0 join t1 on t0.a &gt; t1.c and t0.b = t1.d 有多个 On 条件且其中包含等值条件，走 Hash Join 算子\nselect * from t0 join t1 on t0.a = t1.c or t0.b &gt; t1.d 有多个 On 条件且其中包含等值条件，但是是“或”的关系，走 Nested Loop Join 算子\n\n执行模式\nHash Join 有两种执行模式：CollectLeft 和 Partitioned\n\nCollectLeft 模式更加通用，会先将左表数据全部读取出来构建哈希表（被所有线程共享），然后跟右表 join\nPartitioned 模式并行度更高，但要求左右表的 partition 数量相同并且分区方式都是以等值连接条件中的表达式进行哈希分区（例如 on t0.a = t1.c，左表需要按照 t0.a 进行哈希分区，右表需要按照 t1.c 进行哈希分区），它只需将左右表对应 partition 数据进行 join，无需构建一个全局的哈希表\n\n\nPartitioned 模式下左右表数据的分布：左右表中具有相同 join keys（等值） 的行一定被分布到左右对应相同的 partition 中（例如左右表中 join key 值为 2 的行均被分布到各自的 1 号 partition 中）。\n\n执行模式选择策略：\n\n当用户希望并行度为 1 时，会采用 CollectLeft 模式\n当用户不希望运行时收集统计数据时，默认走 Partitioned 模式\n通过统计数据来选择执行模式，如果左右表数据量至少有一个比较小，则走 CollectLeft 模式，否则走 Partitioned 模式\n\n优化\nHash Join 主要参与以下优化\n\nprojection push down：优化器会尝试将 projection 下推到 Hash Join 算子的输入，如果无法下推，会尝试将 projection 嵌入到 Hash Join 算子中\n\nenforce distribution\n\n对于 CollectLeft 模式，在左表上插入 Coalesce Partitions / Sort Preserving Merge 算子，将其所有 partition 合并成 1 个\n对于 Partitioned 模式，在左右表上插入 Repartition 算子，将其分区方式改成按等值连接条件哈希分区\n\n\njoin selection\n\n优化器会根据 join 两边输入的统计信息，将小表放到左侧，大表放到右侧\n如果左右输入均为无界且增量的（增量的意思是例如 filter 这种接收一批处理一批），则转换为 Symmetric Hash Join\n\n\n\n执行\n以 Partitioned 模式为例，SQL 为 select * from t0 full join t1 on t0.a = t1.c and t0.b &gt; t1.d，左右表的每个 partition 都会经历如下阶段，以第 0 号 partition 为例\n第一阶段：build 阶段\n对左表的 partition0 所有数据构建哈希表，其中 key 为 t0.a 列值的哈希值，value 为行索引（这里会处理哈希冲突情况）。\n例如左表 partition0 数据如下\n行索引t0.at0.b\n031\n160\n245\n\n第二阶段：probe 阶段\nprobe 阶段不断读取右表 partition0 的数据，与左表 partition0 数据进行 join。\n第一步，从右表读取一批数据，计算这一批数据 t1.c 列值的哈希值\n例如右表这一批数据如下\n行索引t1.ct1.d\n026\n142\n233\n\n第二步，使用第一步中计算的哈希值，从 build 阶段构建的左表的哈希表中查找满足等值连接条件 t0.a = t1.c 的行索引，然后根据行索引来比较 t0.a 列与 t1.c 列是否真的相等\n左表行索引右表行索引\n02\n21\n\n第三步，使用非等值连接条件 t0.b &gt; t1.d 进行过滤\n左表行索引右表行索引\n21\n\n第四步，根据 join 类型调整行索引\n\n如果是 inner join，则不调整\n如果是 left join，在第三阶段输出未匹配的左表数据\n如果是 right join，则追加右表未匹配的行\n如果是 full

Vec&lt;u64&gt;，自己计算哈希值和解决哈希冲突，RawTable 存放无冲突的哈希值到行索引映射，Vec&lt;u64&gt; 存放哈希冲突的映射。哈希表的内存是一次性分配好，后续不会扩容（使用 with_capacity 创建来保证）。\n假设左表的数据共有 10 行，在建立哈希表时，会分配一个容量为 10 的 RawTable 和 Vec&lt;u64&gt;。\n以下是插入过程。由于 0 被用作默认值，所以存放行索引时采用 +1 存储。当遇到哈希冲突时，会将原 RawTable 中的 value 存入到 Vec&lt;u64&gt; 中，放置到行索引指向的地方。\n\n在检索时，例如查找 hash 值为 10 的所有行索引\n\n从 RawTable 中找到 key 为 10 的映射，即 10 -&gt; 5\n使用上面拿到的 5（实际行索引为 4）从 Vec&lt;u64&gt; 拿到 3\n使用上面拿到的 3（实际行索引为 2）从 Vec&lt;u64&gt; 拿到 1\n使用上面拿到的 1（实际行索引为 0）从 Vec&lt;u64&gt; 拿到 0\n由于上面拿到的值为 0，停止检索\n最终检索到的结果是 5, 3, 1，因此实际行索引结果是 4, 2, 0\n\n保持输出顺序和输入顺序一致\n以上例子中输入的顺序是 0, 2, 4，而哈希检索结果中的顺序是 4, 2, 0。因此为了保持顺序一致，在构建哈希表时，DataFusion 会对输入数据进行翻转。\n","id":"https://systemxlabs.github.io/blog/datafusion-hash-join/","title":"DataFusion 查询引擎 Hash

API，最后通过与 DuckDB 比较来表明使用开放标准和可扩展性的设计并不会影响性能。\n传统上，高性能分析查询引擎领域一直由紧密集成的系统主导（如 Vertica、Spark 和 DuckDB）。在如今机器学习等新需求催动下，重复造轮子开发新引擎人力昂贵且没有必要。DataFusion 具有竞争力的性能和可扩展性表明，现代 OLAP 引擎不需要一个紧密结合的架构。\n基础生态\nDataFusion 构建在以下基础技术之上\n\nApache Arrow：高效的列式内存数据格式，并提供一个高性能的计算核心\nApache Parquet：列式存储文件格式，高效压缩和编码，内嵌 Schema，支持索引，支持 projection 和 filter 下推\nRust：新的系统编程语言，内存安全，高性能，易嵌入其他系统（无 Runtime，C ABI 兼容），生态丰富，开发者友好（工具链，Cargo 包管理）\n\nDataFusion 采用这些开放标准的技术，使其更容易与其他系统集成（直接可分享的文件和内存数据交换）。\n使用案例\n\n定制数据库：如时序领域 InfluxDB 和 Coralogix，流数据处理 Synnada 和 Arroyo\n执行引擎：如作为 Spark 的执行引擎 Comet 和 Blaze，作为 PostgreSQL 的执行引擎 Seafowl\nSQL 分析工具：如 dask-sql\n表格式：如 Delta Lake、Apache Iceberg 和 Lance 来用 DataFusion 来拉取和解码远端数据、谓词下推等\n\n使用 DataFusion 可以不必重复造轮子，将人力放到更有价值的功能上面。\n数据库模块化\n数据库一个长期趋势是从“one size fits all”通用系统逐渐转向“fit for purpose”专用系统，因此诞生了 Apache Calcite、Velox 和本项目。\n类似于编译领域的 LLVM，模块化的设计催生出了 Rust、Swift、Zig 和 Julia 等语言。\nDataFusion 功能介绍\n\nDataFusion 的模块化实现遵循业界最佳实践\n\nCatalog 和 Data Sources：提供 schema、数据布局和位置信息。支持 parquet/avro/json/csv 等格式开箱即用\nFront End：负责创建逻辑计划。支持 SQL 同时还提供了 DataFrame 和 LogicalPlanBuilder API\nOptimizer：优化逻辑计划和表达式\nPhysicalPlanner：将逻辑计划转为物理计划\nPhysicalOptimizer：基于数据布局等信息优化物理计划\n物理计划采用流式执行\n\nDataFusion 支持 Protobuf 和 Substrait 来序列化和反序列化逻辑计划和物理计划。\nDataFusion 内置的开箱即用功能（如优化规则、用户自定义函数、Datasource）和用户扩展均使用同一个 API 实现。\n执行引擎\nimpl Stream for MyOperator {\n    ...\n    // 拉取下一次输入（可能在 await 处 yield）\n    while let Some(batch) = stream.next().await {\n        // 计算，检查输出是否准备就绪\n        if Some(output) = self.process(&amp;batch)? {\n            // “返回” RecordBatch 给输出 \n            tx.send(batch).await\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nDataFusion 采用基于 Pull 的流式执行引擎。物理计划使用一个或多个 Stream 来并行执行，而 Stream 采用 Rust 异步实现并通过 Tokio 调度，达到了跟 Morsel-driven parallelism: a NUMA-aware query evaluation framework for the many-core age 论文类似的伸缩能力。\n\n优化\n内置实现了业界广泛使用的优化\n\n查询重写：逻辑计划重写如谓词下推、表达式简化，物理计划重写如消除不必要排序、最大化并行度、join算法选择\n排序：如针对 Limit（topk）优化，内存不足时临时写入磁盘\n分组和聚合优化：两阶段并行哈希分组聚合\n连接：支持 hash join / merge join / symmetric hash join / nested loops join / cross join\n窗口函数：复用排序、支持流式计算\nNormalized Sort Keys / RowFormat\n有效利用排序顺序\n下推和延迟物化\n\n扩展性\n\n用户自定义函数：标量/聚合/窗口\nCatalog：TableProvider 表示一张表，SchemaProvider 是包含多个 TableProvider 的集合，CatalogProvider 是包含多个 SchemaProviders 的集合\nData Source：使用 TableProvider 表示，支持分区输入、谓词/filter/limit下推、预排序、统计信息等\nExecution Environment：提供了 MemoryPool、DiskManager、CacheManager 等支持执行中临时写入磁盘、算子间共享资源\n新的查询前端\n查询重写：包括逻辑计划和物理计划\n关系运算符：使用 ExecutionPlan 来扩展新的运算符\n\n用户均可扩展以上功能。\n性能评估\n单核执行\nTPC-H\n\nH2O-G\n\n使用开放标准技术并不会从根本上限制 DataFusion 的性能，而且 DataFusion 社区正在针对这些 benchmark 做优化。\n多核执行\nClickBench\n\nDataFusion 的模块化设计和 Pull-based 执行引擎并不会阻碍其获取最先进的多核性能。DataFusion 在多核上具有很好的伸缩性。\n结论\n自从引入 LLVM 以来，从头开始构建编译器的需求已显著减少。随着 DataFusion 等技术的出现，从头开始构建数据库系统的需求也将变得同样罕见。当然，如果有足够的工程投资，紧密集成的引擎理论上可以胜过模块化引擎。然而，随着实现最先进功能和性能的成本不断增加，我们相信广泛使用的模块化引擎（例如 DataFusion）将吸引大型开源社区的投资，逐渐提供更丰富的功能集和除了拥有大量资源的紧密集成设计引擎之外的最好的性能。\n模块化设计绝不是构建系统的唯一策略，我们不断看到新的紧密集成的系统的出现。然而，随着对 DataFusion 等系统的认识不断增强，我们预测会有更多项目采用模块化引擎，新的分析系统将会出现爆炸式增长，这在以前是不可能的。\n注：论文标题为 Apache Arrow

&amp;[DataType]) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;DataType&gt;&gt; {\n        not_impl_err!(\"Function {} does not implement coerce_types\", self.name())\n    }\n}\n\nfn as_any(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;dyn Any\n返回 Any 动态类型。\n可以在运行时通过类型来判断函数具体是哪种，比如 func.as_any().downcast_ref::&lt;LogFunc&gt;().is_some() 来判断是否为 LogFunc。\nfn name(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str\n返回函数名称，如 abs。\n函数名称会被作为函数唯一标识注册到 FunctionRegistry 中。\nfn aliases(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[String]\n返回函数的所有别名。\n每个别名也会作为唯一标识注册 FunctionRegistry 中，其对应的均是同一个 UDF 实例。\nfn display_name(&amp;self, args: &amp;[Expr]) -&gt; Result&lt;String&gt;\n返回展示名称，包含函数名和参数，如 abs(t1.a)。\n在打印逻辑计划、生成列名等情况均会用到。\nfn signature(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Signature\n返回函数入参类型和易变性（Volatility）\n\n入参类型支持固定、变长参数、任意参数等等，还可以在运行时指定参数（使用 coerce_types 方法）\n易变性包括三种，主要用在判断是否为常量表达式时，比如 abs(10)，可以直接在 planning 期间进行求值\n\nImmutable：给定输入只会有一种输出，比如 abs(num)\nStable：给定输入，在同一查询内只会有一种输出，但在不同查询间可能会有不同的输出，比如 current_time()\nVolatile：每次执行时均可能产生不同的输出，比如 random()\n\n\n\nfn return_type_from_exprs(&amp;self, args: &amp;[Expr], schema: &amp;dyn ExprSchema, arg_types: &amp;[DataType]) -&gt; Result&lt;DataType&gt;\n返回函数的返回类型。\n返回类型可能是动态变化的，比如 arrow_cast(x, 'Int16') 和 arrow_cast(x, 'Float32') 会返回不同的类型。\nfn invoke(&amp;self, args: &amp;[ColumnarValue]) -&gt; Result&lt;ColumnarValue&gt;\n调用函数，返回执行结果。\n因为是向量化执行，输入的是每个参数列的 Array（包含多行），返回结果列的 Array，行数量必须跟参数的行数量一致。\nfn simplify(&amp;self, args: Vec&lt;Expr&gt;, info: &amp;dyn SimplifyInfo) -&gt; Result&lt;ExprSimplifyResult&gt;\n根据输入参数的表达式，来进行表达式简化。\n比如 current_time()会简化成一个字面量表达式。\nfn short_circuits(&amp;self) -&gt; bool\n返回函数是否短路。\n短路是指在求值时，只要最终的结果已经可以确定，求值过程便告终止。比如 OR 逻辑运算符，只要有一个条件为 true，就会停止后续求值。因此短路表达式对计算顺序是有要求的。\n在公共子表达式消除优化中，如果函数是短路的，则会跳过不做优化。\n比如在如下 SQL 中（已做简化，原例子参考issue-8848），\nselect \ncase when a &gt; 0 then c / a else 0 end,\ncase when a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 then c / a else 0 end\nfrom t;\n\n公共子表达式消除优化时，会把公共子表达式 c / a 提取出来提前计算，从而导致除零错误。\nfn evaluate_bounds(&amp;self, input: &amp;[&amp;Interval]) -&gt; Result&lt;Interval&gt;\n根据子表达式是输入区间，计算函数的输出区间。\n比如 abs(a) 的子表达式 a 的区间为 [-3, 2]，则输出区间为 [0, 3]。默认实现返回无穷的区间。\n在 Filter 算子中，会根据谓词和输入算子的统计数据，计算列的边界值（min/max/distinct_count），根据前后变化计算选择率（selectivity）。\nfn propagate_constraints(&amp;self, interval: &amp;Interval, inputs: &amp;[&amp;Interval]) -&gt; Result&lt;Option&lt;Vec&lt;Interval&gt;&gt;&gt;\n根据自身的输出区间，以及子表达式的区间，重新计算子表达式的可能区间（被进一步缩小）。\n比如 abs(num) 自身输出区间为 [4, 5]，而子表达式区间为 [-7, 3]，可以计算出子表达式只能在 [-5, 3] 区间内。\n在 Filter 算子中，谓词的取值区间在 [true, true]，会以此为限制区间向下传播，更新每个子表达式的取值区间。\nfn output_ordering(&amp;self, inputs: &amp;[ExprProperties]) -&gt; Result&lt;SortProperties&gt;\n根据子表达式的排序属性，返回输出的排序属性。\n比如 cos(num) 输出的排序属性是 Unordered，radians(num)（将度数转为弧度）输出的排序属性跟输入保持一致，即为 input[0].sort_properties。\n这些排序属性会作为等价属性（EquivalenceProperties）一部分，在 Join、Sort 等优化中使用。\nfn coerce_types(&amp;self, arg_types: &amp;[DataType]) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;DataType&gt;&gt;\n对于入参类型为用户自定义类型时，在运行时拿到实际入参类型，返回需要强制转换后的入参类型。\nDataFusion 会将入参强制转换为这些类型，然后再执行 UDF 的 invoke 方法。\n比如 make_array(expression1[, ..., expression_n]) 会找出入参类型中最大的类型，然后将每个入参强制转换为此类型。例如 make_array(1, 2.2) 会将每个入参转换为 Float64 类型。\nUDF 如何序列化和反序列化？\n在分布式下，需要通过网络将执行计划传给其他节点执行，其中需要对 UDF 进行序列化和反序列化。\nDataFusion 提供了两种方式对 UDF 进行序列化和反序列化\n\n只传输 UDF 名称，在反序列化时从 FunctionRegistry 通过名称拿到实际的 UDF，这需要 UDF 在两个节点上的 FunctionRegistry 均被注册\n用户自定义 UDF 序列化和反序列化方法\n\nDataFusion 会优先使用用户自定义的序列化和反序列化方法，如果用户未实现，则 fallback 到使用 UDF 名称方案。\n","id":"https://systemxlabs.github.io/blog/datafusion-udf/","title":"DataFusion 查询引擎 UDF

架构和函数调用规约\nRISC-V 是一个模块化的精简指令集架构，这里我们以 RV64I 模块（64 位基本整数指令集）为例\n\n包含基本的整数运算指令（算术/逻辑/移位）、分支和跳转指令、内存交互指令\n提供 32 个整数寄存器（x0-x31），其中 x0 硬连线为 0（恒为 0），这些寄存器有一些别名，如 x1 用于存放函数返回地址，也称 ra 寄存器，x2 用于存放栈指针，也称 sp 寄存器\n指令长度为 32 位，寄存器位宽是 64\n\n寄存器组保存者功能\na0~a7（x10~x17）调用者保存用来传递输入参数，其中的 a0 和 a1 还用来保存返回值\nt0~t6 (x5~x7, x28~x31)调用者保存作为临时寄存器使用，在被调函数中可以随意使用无需保存\ns0~s11 (x8~x9, x18~x27)被调用者保存作为临时寄存器使用，被调函数保存后才能在被调函数中使用，其中 fp (s0) 也可作为栈帧指针寄存器，表示当前栈帧的起始位置\nra (x1)被调用者保存存放函数返回地址\nsp (x2)被调用者保存栈指针寄存器，指向栈顶位置\nzero (x0)N/A恒为零\n\n何为调用者保存寄存器和被调用者保存寄存器？\n\n由于每个 CPU 只有一套寄存器，函数调用前后会导致寄存器的值被覆盖，因此需要将寄存器的值提前保存到栈上，后续从栈上恢复这些寄存器的值，这个过程由函数调用者和被调用者合作完成\n被调用者保存 (Callee-Saved) 寄存器 ：被调用的函数可能会覆盖这些寄存器，需要被调用的函数来保存的寄存器，即由被调用的函数来保证在调用前后，这些寄存器保持不变\n调用者保存 (Caller-Saved) 寄存器 ：被调用的函数可能会覆盖这些寄存器，需要发起调用的函数来保存的寄存器，即由发起调用的函数来保证在调用前后，这些寄存器保持不变\n\n函数调用是通过压栈和出栈的方式，每个函数执行都有其对应的栈帧\n\n一个函数可能的栈帧内容\n\n它的开头和结尾分别在 sp 和 fp 寄存器所指向的地址。按照地址从高到低分别有以下内容，它们都是通过 sp 加上一个偏移量来访问的：\n\nra 寄存器保存子函数返回之后需要跳转的地址\n父亲栈帧的结束地址 fp\n其他被调用者保存寄存器 s1 ~ s11 \n函数所使用到的局部变量\n\n函数 A 调用函数 B 具体完整过程（抛开编译器优化）：\n\n函数 A 保存“调用者保存寄存器”到其栈帧内\n函数 A 设置输入参数到 a0-a7 寄存器\n函数 A 跳转到函数 B 入口并设置 ra 寄存器为函数 A 跳转指令的下一条指令地址（pc + 4），这个过程是一条指令完成\n函数 B 向下移动 sp 栈指针来分配其栈帧空间，例如 addi sp, sp, -64 分配 64 字节栈帧\n函数 B 保存 ra 寄存器到其栈帧内，例如 sd  ra, 56(sp)\n函数 B 保存“被调用者保存寄存器”到其栈帧内\n函数 B 更新 fp 寄存器为其栈帧顶端地址，例如 addi fp, sp, 64\n函数 B 从 a0-a7 寄存器读取输入参数并执行（可能继续调用其他函数）\n函数 B 将返回值保存到 a0-a1 寄存器\n函数 B 从其栈帧内恢复 ra 寄存器，例如 ld  ra, 56(sp)\n函数 B 从其栈帧内恢复“被调用者保存寄存器”\n函数 B 向上移动 sp 栈指针来回收其栈帧空间，例如 addi sp, sp, 64 回收 64 字节栈帧\n函数 B 跳转到 ra 寄存器指向的返回地址，例如 jalr x0, 0(ra)\n函数 A 从其栈帧内恢复“调用者保存寄存器”\n函数 A 继续向下执行\n\n更详细介绍可见此文章。\n注：以下线程均指绿色线程。\n定义一个线程\nstruct Thread {\n    id: usize,\n    stack: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,\n    ctx: ThreadContext,\n    state: State,\n}\n\nenum

表示已分配任务，可以被调度执行，任务可能未开始也可能被中途挂起了\n任务上下文：被调用者保存寄存器，用于恢复挂起的任务继续执行；entry 是任务的入口地址，只在首次被调度时使用\n栈：分配在进程对应的堆区（固定大小、不会扩容）\n\n定义线程运行时\nstatic mut RUNTIME: usize = 0;\n\npub struct Runtime {\n    threads:

线程，用于用户任务的代码执行，此时没有绑定任务，因此状态均为 Available\n\n使用全局变量存储 Runtime 地址，便于后续全局访问 Runtime。\n创建用户任务\nimpl Runtime {\n    pub fn spawn(&amp;mut self, f: fn()) {\n        let available = self\n

task_return 地址执行，然后调用 Runtime::t_return() 来标记当前线程空闲，并调度/切换到下一个 ready 的线程继续执行\n\n调度线程\nimpl Runtime {\n    pub fn run(&amp;mut self) {\n        while self.t_yield() {}\n        println!(\"All tasks

可以跨线程共享引用，满足 Sync\n\n几乎所有 primitives 类型都是 Sync，比如 bool、i32、array等，而裸指针 pointer 类型并不是\n基于以上 primitives 的 struct、tuple 和 enum 也都会自动实现 Sync\n\n\n内部可变性原语 UnsafeCell 不是 Sync\n\n在其上没有通过同步机制构建的类型（比如 Rc 和 RefCell）也不是 Sync\n在其上通过同步机制构建的类型（比如 AtomicBool、Arc、Mutex 等）则可以是 Sync\n\n\n\nSend 和 Sync 都是 auto marker trait，编译器会自动给每个符合的类型自动实现该 trait，也可以手动通过 impl !Send for XXX 来显示地标识某类型不是 Send。\n推导结论\nT: Sync &lt;=&gt; &amp;T: Send\n\n如果 T 是 Sync，说明可以在线程间安全的共享引用，所以 &amp;T 可以被安全的 Send。相反，如果 T 不是 Sync，那么其引用 &amp;T 就不能被安全地 Send\n如果 &amp;T 是 Send，说明 T 的引用可以在线程间安全地发送，所以 T 是 Sync。相反，如果 &amp;T 不能安全的 Send，那么 T 就不是 Sync\n\nT: Sync &lt;=&gt; &amp;T: Sync\n\nT 是 Sync，所以 &amp;T 是 Send。&amp;T 是 Sync 的前提是 &amp;&amp;T 为 Send，而 &amp;&amp;T 实际就是 &amp;T（共享是可传递的），所以 &amp;&amp;T 也是 Send，那么 &amp;T 则为 Sync\n\nT: Sync &lt;=&gt; &amp;mut T: Sync\n\nT 是 Sync，所以 &amp;T 是 Send。&amp;mut T 是 Sync 的前提是 &amp;&amp;mut T 为 Send，而 &amp;&amp;mut T 实际就是 &amp;T，所以 &amp;&amp;mut T 也是 Send，那么 &amp;mut T 则为 Sync\n\nT: Send &lt;=&gt; &amp;mut T: Send\n\n&amp;mut T 某种程度可以看作拥有 T 的所有权（只不过它不能将 T 完全 drop，需要保证引用在其生命周期内有效），因为 &amp;mut T 可以通过 *ref = T 来覆写其整个数据（原数据被 drop），也可以通过 std::mem::replace 将其指向的原数据 move 走\n所以 &amp;mut T 是 Send 的前提是 T 必须可以在线程间安全地 move，即 T 为 Send\n\n以上结论的两边都是等价的，可以互相推导。\n实际例子\nSend + Sync\n\n绝大多数 primitives 类型：bool、i32、array\nAtomic* 类型：AtomicBool、AtomicI32\n基于 Send + Sync 类型构建的 struct、tuple、enum\n\nSend

Sync（impl&lt;T: ?Sized + Sync&gt; Sync for MutexGuard&lt;'_, T&gt;）\n\n!Send + !Sync\n\nRc，其内部引用计数非原子更新，Rc 和 &amp;Rc 均无法发送到其他线程，因为两者都可以通过 clone 改变内部引用计数器\n\nArc\n\nunsafe impl&lt;T: ?Sized + Sync + Send, A: Allocator + Send&gt; Send for Arc&lt;T, A&gt; {}\n\n因为 Arc 是共享所有权，因此不确定 T 最终会在哪个线程上被 drop，因此 Arc 是 Send 的前提之一是 T 是 Send\nArc 可以通过 Deref 拿到 &amp;T，因此在线程间发送 Arc 等价于发送 &amp;T，而 &amp;T 可以被安全发送的前提是 T 必须是 Sync\n\n\nunsafe impl&lt;T: ?Sized + Sync + Send, A: Allocator + Sync&gt; Sync for Arc&lt;T, A&gt; {}，在线程间发送 Arc 或其引用 &amp;Arc 本质是一样的，因为两者都可以通过 clone 拿到一个新的 Arc\n\nMutex\n\nunsafe impl&lt;T: ?Sized + Send&gt; Send for Mutex&lt;T&gt; {}，如果 T 不是 Send，那么 Mutex 被发送到其他线程后获取锁 MutexGuard，进而通过 DerefMut 获取到 &amp;mut T，而 &amp;mut T 可以将其原值 drop 或者 move，存在问题。因此 T 必须 Send，Mutex 才会是 Send\nunsafe impl&lt;T: ?Sized + Send&gt; Sync for Mutex&lt;T&gt; {}，如果 T 不是 Send，那么 Mutex 的引用被共享到其他线程后仍能获取锁 MutexGuard，进而通过 DerefMut 获取到 &amp;mut T，而 &amp;mut T 可以将其原值 drop 或者 move，存在问题。因此 T 必须 Send，Mutex 才会是 Sync\n\nRwLock\n\nunsafe impl&lt;T: ?Sized + Send&gt; Send for RwLock&lt;T&gt; {}，如果 T 不是 Send，那么 RwLock 被发送到其他线程后获取写锁 RwLockWriteGuard，进而通过 DerefMut 获取到 &amp;mut T，而 &amp;mut T 可以将其原值

&amp;mut T，而 &amp;mut T 可以将其原值 drop 或者 move，存在问题。因此 T 必须 Send，RwLock 才会是 Sync\n如果 T 不是 Sync，那么 RwLock 的引用被共享到其他线程后可能多个线程同时获取到读锁 RwLockReadGuard，进而通过 Deref 获取到 &amp;T，而 T 不是 Sync 的话，那么多线程同时使用 &amp;T 存在问题。因此 T 必须 Sync，RwLock 才会是 Sync\n\n\nRwLock 跟 Mutex

async-executor 库，理解最重要的 IO 多路复用 / reactor / driver / task / executor 等概念。\npolling\npolling 对 epoll / kqueue / iocp 等各平台的 IO 多路复用机制进行了一个统一的抽象，方便跨平台使用。\n它提供了一个 Poller 结构体，封装了各平台的 IO 多路复用机制（例如 Linux 下则包含 epoll_create1 返回的文件描述符），并主要提供了三个方法\n\n增删改感兴趣的 IO 事件（参考 epoll_ctl）\n阻塞等待新的 IO 事件（参考 epoll_wait）\n唤醒正在阻塞等待中的自身\n\n以 Linux 下 epoll 为例分析其细节，\n\n创建 Poller 时，调用 epoll_create1 创建一个新的 epoll 实例并保存到 Poller 中，同时往 epoll 列表中注册两个 IO 源\n\n调用 eventfd 创建用于通知（唤醒）的对象 notifier\n调用 timerfd_create 创建的定时器\n\n\n增删改感兴趣的 IO 事件时，传入其所属的文件描述符（例如 socket），关联数据（当返回 IO 事件时携带），以及一些标志位（比如只监听可读或可写事件）\n阻塞等待新的 IO 事件时，可传入超时时间，当有新的 IO 事件（一个或多个） / 中断 / 超时，结束阻塞返回。这里并没有使用 epoll_wait 本身的超时机制，而是使用更为精确的定时器，在调用 epoll_wait 前会通过 timerfd_settime 设置定时器超时时间，当超时时间到达时，会在 timer 文件描述符上产生一个新的 IO 事件来结束阻塞\n唤醒正在阻塞等待中的自身时，通过调用 write 往 notifier 文件描述符上写入数据来触发一个新的 IO 事件来结束阻塞\n\n具体例子\n// 创建一个 socket\nlet socket = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:8000\")?;\nsocket.set_nonblocking(true)?;\n\n// 指定 socket 标识符（epoll 返回新的 IO 事件时会携带）\nlet key = 7;\n\n// 创建一个 epoll 实例，并执行初始化工作（注册 notifier 和 timer 到 epoll 列表中）\nlet poller = Poller::new()?;\n\n// 将 socket 添加到 epoll 队列中，监听其可读事件\nunsafe {\n    poller.add(&amp;socket, Event::readable(key))?;\n}\n\nlet mut events = Events::new();\nloop {\n    events.clear();\n\n    // 阻塞等待新的 IO 事件（这里并未传入超时时间）\n    poller.wait(&amp;mut events, None)?;\n\n    for ev in events.iter() {\n        // 如果发现 socket 可读事件，则执行下一步操作\n        if ev.key == key {\n            socket.accept()?;\n            // 继续监听 socket 可读事件\n            poller.modify(&amp;socket, Event::readable(key))?;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// 在 socket drop 前必须要将其从 epoll 列表中移除\npoller.delete(&amp;socket)?;\n\nasync-io\nasync-io 提供了一个全局唯一的 Reactor 实例来支持对定时器 Timer 和 IO 对象的事件监听，它利用了 polling 提供的 IO 多路复用抽象。Reactor 并不会主动去轮询监听新事件，而是需要一个 Driver 来进行驱动，Driver 实际上就是一个独立的 OS 线程，它会一直循环不断的驱动 Reactor。\n在 Reactor 之上提供了两个面向用户的工具：\n\nAsync：用于构建异步 IO 的适配器，用户使用它来包装同步 IO 类型（如 std::net::TcpStream），然后提供异步的 IO 读写能力\nTimer: 用户可以创建一个 Timer 来周期性的发出事件，Timer 实现了 Future 和 Stream trait，用户可以对它进行 poll 或 poll_next\n\nReactor\nReactor 提供了 insert_io / remove_io / insert_timer / remove_timer 方法来向 Reactor （取消）注册 IO 对象或者定时器，对于 IO 对象，会（取消）注册到底层 OS 的 IO 多路复用机制上（如 epoll）。\n/// IO 源\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub(crate) struct Source {\n    /// IO 文件描述符\n    registration: Registration,\n\n    /// IO 源的 ID，注册到 epoll 时携带，用它来区分 IO 事件来自哪个 IO 源\n    key: usize,\n\n    /// IO 源的读端和写端的状态，和监听它的 wakers\n    state: Mutex&lt;[Direction; 2]&gt;,\n}\n\nReactor 将 IO 源封装为一个 Source 结构，上层持有 Source 可以进行 poll，如果 IO 源 ready 则返回 Poll::Ready，否则 Reactor 会保存 waker 并返回 Poll::Pending。一个 IO 源可以被多个 wakers 来监听。\nReactor 的核心是 fn react(&amp;mut self, timeout: Option&lt;Duration&gt;) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; 方法，它会阻塞线程直到有新的 IO / timer 事件（如果传入了超时时间则可能超时返回），当收到新的事件后，通过 poll 传递下来的 waker 来进行唤醒。它通过 Mutex 被限制为只能有一个线程来执行，无法并发执行。\nReactor 通过 tick 机制来保证 IO 事件是否是“新鲜的”，在每轮 react 方法执行期间，tick 值都会自增 1。\nDriver\n因为 epoll 的模型就是需要用户去轮询，它不会主动推送 IO 事件，所以我们需要 Driver 来驱动。Driver 是一个单独的 OS 线程，在 Reactor 初始化时一并创建。它不断循环的去尝试获取 Reactor 锁并执行其 react 方法，然后 react 方法会阻塞 Driver 线程直至有新的 timer / IO 事件产生。\nAsync\nAsync 的原理是通过异步机制监控 IO 源是否 ready，对其进行 poll 的结果是 IO 源是否可读或可写，而不是读取或写入数据到 IO 源。所以当我们需要执行同步 IO 操作时，先让 Async 监控 IO 源是否 ready，当 IO 源 ready 了再执行同步 IO 操作，这时就不会发生 IO 阻塞线程了。\nasync fn my_server() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let listener = Async::new(std::net::TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")?)?;\n    loop {\n        let (_stream, addr) = listener.read_with(|io: &amp;std::net::TcpListener| io.accept()).await?;\n        println!(\"Accepted connection from: {}\", addr);\n    }\n}\n\n以上示例创建了一个同步的 std::net::TcpListener 并用 Async 包装起来，然后就可以异步地监听新连接。其过程是\n\nstd::net::TcpListener 实现了 AsFd trait，Async 获取其 IO 文件描述符\n通过 fcntl 系统调用将其设置为非阻塞 IO\n然后 IO 对象注册到 Reactor 中，获取其 Source 引用\n在 Async 被 poll 时，会通过其内部持有的 Source 来执行 poll，此时 IO 源未 ready，则 Reactor 会保存其 waker，返回 Poll::Pending\n等到有新的 IO 事件时，Reactor 再通过 waker 通知\nAsync 被再次 poll，此时 IO 源 ready，返回 Poll::Ready(Ok(()))\n然后再执行 std::net::TcpListener::accept 同步方法，此时执行 accept 不会阻塞，而是会立刻返回\n\nasync-task\nasync-task 提供了异步任务的抽象封装，异步任务 RawTask 包含 future 以及 future 运行时所需的内容，基于 RawTask 对外提供了两个安全的封装 Runnable 和 Task。Runnable 主要给上层 Executor 使用，Executor 可以使用 Runnable 触发一次调度或者执行一次 poll。Task 主要面向用户使用，用户可以 await Task，也可以取消 Task 或者让 Task 后台运行。\n\n以上是 RawTask 的内存布局，包含：\n\nstate: 任务状态\nawaiter: 用户 poll Task 时注册的 waker\nvtable: 指向一个静态变量，包含各种函数指针\n\nschedule: 实际会调用 custom_schedule\ndrop_future: 析构 future\nget_output: 读取 future 结果\ndrop_ref: 减少任务引用计数，当引用计数归零时，调用 destroy 销毁任务\ndestroy: 清理任务的资源和内存\nrun: 执行异步任务\nclone_waker: 克隆一个新的 waker\n\n\nmetadata: Executor 传入的自定义数据\ncustom_schedule: Executor 传入的调度方法，RawTask 使用它来向 Executor 触发一次调度\nfuture / output: 一块 union 区域，存放 future 或者其结果 output\n\n其中 clone_waker、wake、wake_by_ref 和 drop_waker 组成了标准库 RawWakerVTable 的四个方法。\nRawTask 内包含一套引用计数机制，Runnable、Task 和 Waker 都持有对 RawTask 的引用，当引用计数归零时，就会执行 destroy 方法清理 RawTask 资源和内存。\n任务主要有以下状态：\n\nscheduled: 即将被调度执行\nrunning: 正在执行 poll\ncompleted: 任务完成（output 还没被读取）\nclosed: 任务关闭（任务被取消或者 output 已被读取）\n\n创建异步任务\n创建异步任务 fn spawn&lt;F, S&gt;(future: F, schedule: S) -&gt; (Runnable, Task&lt;F::Output&gt;) 需要传入 future 和 custom_schedule 方法，任务初始状态为 scheduled，返回 Runnable 和 Task。\nRunnable\n\nschedule 方法：用于让 Executor 调度该任务，此方法仅调用 custom_schedule 方法，无其他行为\nrun 方法：实际调用 RawTask::run 方法，用于让 Executor 对任务执行 poll 操作，如果任务执行完毕，则将状态改为 completed。如果任务是 closed 状态，会执行资源清理动作\n\nTask\n\npoll_task 方法：如果任务未完成，则注册 waker 并返回 Poll::Pending；如果任务完成了，则读取 output 并将任务置为 closed 状态\ncancel 方法：通过将任务置为 closed 状态，会重新发起一次调度，在执行任务过程中进行后续资源清理动作\ndetach 方法：通过 mem::forget 来不 drop Task，将任务置于后台运行，运行结束后直接将任务置为 closed 状态\n\nWaker: 异步任务内部管理的用于传递给 Reactor 的 waker，当 IO 源 ready 时唤醒异步任务并触发一次调度，一个异步任务可以有多个 IO 源，所以也会有多个 waker\n\nclone_waker: 调用 RawWaker::clone_waker 克隆一个新的 waker\nwake: 通过将任务设置为 scheduled 状态并触发一次调度，清理 waker 关联资源\nwake_by_ref: 通过将任务设置为 scheduled 状态并触发一次调度\ndrop_waker: 减少任务引用计数\n\nAwaiter：用户 await Task （如通过 block_on）时传入的 waker，当异步任务完成时唤醒用户再次 poll 获取 future 结果，一个异步任务对应至多一个 Awaiter（当任务后台运行时则没有）\nasync-executor\nasync-executor 提供了两个简单的 executor 用于执行用户异步任务。\n\nExecutor：实现了 Send + Sync，支持多线程，spawn 方法限制 future 需要实现 Send\nLocalExecutor：对 Executor 的包装，未实现 Send + Sync，限定单线程，spawn 方法不需要 future 实现 Send\n\n核心数据结构为\nstruct State {\n    /// 全局队列\n    queue: ConcurrentQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;,\n\n    /// 本地队列\n    local_queues: RwLock&lt;Vec&lt;Arc&lt;ConcurrentQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n\n    /// 是否已通知 sleeper（不重复通知）\n    notified: AtomicBool,\n\n    /// 等待全局队列新增任务（全局队列为空）\n    sleepers: Mutex&lt;Sleepers&gt;,\n\n    /// 当前活跃任务（通过持有 Waker 保持任务引用计数不归零）\n    active: Mutex&lt;Slab&lt;Waker&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\n\n调度任务（custom_schedule）：通过将任务加入到全局队列中，并通知 sleeper。\n执行任务：从队列获取一个任务，调用 Runnable::run 方法对 future 执行一次 poll。\n\n有两种驱动 executor 的方法：\n\ntick：从全局队列选取一个任务来执行 poll，当全局队列无任务时，注册一个 sleeper 等待\nrun：传入一个 future，运行该 future 直至完成，在运行该 future 同时会运行所属本地队列的其他任务，如果本地队列为空会从全局队列窃取任务，如果全局队列为空会从其他本地队列窃取任务，如果都没有则注册一个 sleeper 等待\n\n实现一个多线程异步运行时\nfn main() {\n    let ex = Executor::new();\n\n    thread::scope(|scope| {\n        for _ in 0..5 {\n            scope.spawn(|| block_on(ex.run(core::future::pending::&lt;()&gt;())));\n        }\n\n        block_on(async {\n            let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\").await.unwrap();\n            loop {\n                let (stream, addr) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();\n                let task = ex.spawn(handle_new_connection(stream, addr));\n                task.detach();\n            }\n        })\n    })\n}\n\nasync fn handle_new_connection(_stream: TcpStream, addr: SocketAddr) {\n    Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;\n    println!(\n        \"[{:?}] Handle connection from: {}\",\n        thread::current().id(),\n        addr\n    );\n}\n\n// 类似于 tokio 以下代码\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\").await.unwrap();\n\n    loop {\n        let (stream, addr) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();\n        tokio::spawn(handle_new_connection(stream, addr));\n    }\n}\n\n由于 Executor 非 static 生命周期，因此采用 Scoped threads 实现多线程，主线程负责监听端口获取新连接，并创建一个后台任务处理，子线程负责从本地队列（会从全局队列或其他本地队列窃取任务）读取任务进行执行。\n","id":"https://systemxlabs.github.io/blog/smol-async-runtime/","title":"Rust 异步运行时 smol

  not,\n        } =&gt; visitor.visit_in_list(expr, list, *not),\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n用户自定义 Visitor（自己处理递归）\npub struct ColumnCounter {\n    count: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Visitor for ColumnCounter {\n    fn visit_column_ref(&amp;mut self, _: &amp;Option&lt;Identifier&gt;, _: &amp;Option&lt;Identifier&gt;, _: &amp;ColumnID) {\n        self.count += 1;\n    }\n    fn visit_is_null(&amp;mut self, expr: &amp;Expr, not: bool) {\n        walk_expr(self, expr)\n    }\n    fn visit_in_list(&amp;mut self, expr: &amp;Expr, list: &amp;[Expr], not: bool) {\n        walk_expr(self, expr)\n        for expr in list {\n            walk_expr(self, expr);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n实现二：代码生成\n新版本的 databend （采用的是 derive-visitor 库）和 datafusion-sqlparser-rs 是采用代码生成实现，通过派生宏给每个类型（包括 AST 类型和标准库中的类型）生成 walk 方法，walk 方法会递归遍历其内部每个元素。\n定义 Walk trait\npub trait Walk {\n    fn walk&lt;V: Visitor&gt;(&amp;self, visitor: &amp;mut V);\n}\n\n利用派生宏给每个 AST 类型生成 Walk trait 实现\n#[derive(Walk)]\npub enum Expr {\n    IsNull {\n        expr: Box&lt;Expr&gt;,\n        not: bool,\n    }\n}\n\n生成代码\nimpl Walk for Expr {\n    fn walk&lt;V: Visitor&gt;(&amp;self, visitor: &amp;mut V) {\n        // 对当前类型中的每个元素递归调用 walk 方法\n        match self {\n            Self::IsNull { expr, not } =&gt; {\n                expr.walk(visitor);\n                not.walk(visitor);\n            }\n            _ =&gt; {}\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n下一步就是如何在 walk 遍历过程中插入对 Visitor 的调用，这也是 derive-visitor 和 datafusion-sqlparser-rs 实现的区别之处。\nderive-visitor\nderive-visitor 采用的方式是在所有 walk 地方插入对 Visitor 的调用，Visitor 通过动态类型 std::any::Any 接收并在运行时判断具体类型。\nderive-visitor 的 Visitor trait 只有一个方法\npub trait Visitor {\n    fn visit(&amp;mut self, item: &amp;dyn Any, event: Event);\n}\npub enum Event {\n    Enter,\n    Exit,\n}\n\nderive-visitor 的派生宏生成代码\nimpl Walk for Expr {\n    fn walk&lt;V: Visitor&gt;(&amp;self, visitor: &amp;mut V) {\n        // walk 前插入对 Visitor 的调用\n        visitor.visit(self, Event::Enter);\n\n        match self {\n            Self::IsNull { expr, not } =&gt; {\n                expr.walk(visitor);\n                not.walk(visitor);\n            }\n            _ =&gt; {}\n        }\n\n        // walk 后插入对 Visitor 的调用\n        visitor.visit(self, Event::Exit);\n    }\n}\n\n用户在实现自己的 Visitor 时，需要手动判断 std::any::Any 的具体类型\npub struct ColumnCounter {\n    count: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Visitor for ColumnCounter {\n    fn visit(&amp;mut self, item: &amp;dyn Any, event: Event) {\n        // 通过 Any 的 downcast 方法判断具体类型\n        if let Some(item) = &lt;dyn ::std::any::Any&gt;::downcast_ref::&lt;ColumnRef&gt;(item) {\n            match event {\n                Event::Enter =&gt; { self.count += 1; }\n                _ =&gt; {}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndatafusion-sqlparser-rs\ndatafusion-sqlparser-rs 采用的方式是通过属性宏指定在某些 walk 地方插入对 Visitor 的调用。\n#[derive(Walk)]\n#[walk(with = \"visit_expr\")]\npub enum Expr { ... }\n\n生成代码\nimpl Walk for Expr {\n    fn walk&lt;V: Visitor&gt;(&amp;self, visitor: &amp;mut V) {\n        // walk 前插入对 Visitor 的调用\n        visitor.pre_visit_expr(self);\n\n        match self {\n            Self::IsNull { expr, not } =&gt; {\n                expr.walk(visitor);\n                not.walk(visitor);\n            }\n            _ =&gt; {}\n        }\n\n        // walk 后插入对 Visitor 的调用\n        visitor.post_visit_expr(self);\n    }\n}\n\n","id":"https://systemxlabs.github.io/blog/visitor-pattern/","title":"Visitor 模式的两种不同实现分析"},"https://systemxlabs.github.io/notes/":{"body":"Papers I have
